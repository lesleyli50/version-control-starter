# Version control homework starter

*HELLO*, and welcome to this homework on version control. 

In this homework assignment, you'll 1) clone a
[git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) repo from
[GitHub](https://github.com/); 2) add a file; 
3) commit your changes; and, 4) push your changes
back up to GitHub. It's easy and fun.

## Verbose instructions

If you're reading this file (I KNOW THAT YOU ARE), the
copy of the file could be in many places. I'm writing
this file on my laptop in the wee hours of Friday Sep 21, 2018.
This file is called `README.md`, and it is written
in [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)
format, which is a popular format for writing documentation.
If you're looking at the file on GitHub, it is likely that
the Markdown has been compiled to HTML for your viewing
pleasure. In that case, it will have clickable links,
text with different formatting, and other niceties.

I'm about to commit this file to version control. In fact,
I'll do so right now.
