# Version control homework starter

*HELLO*, and welcome to this homework on version control. 

In this homework assignment, you'll 1) clone a
[git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) repo from
[GitHub](https://github.com/); 2) add a file; 
3) commit your changes; and, 4) push your changes
back up to GitHub. It's easy and fun.

## Short instructions

After starting the assignment by accepting the GitHub Classroom
invitiation, you'll have a repo with this file in it. I want to
to add a file to that repo called "me.txt". That file needs to
have your class nickname somewhere in it. And, you need to ensure
you push your work back up to GitHub.

## Verbose instructions

If you're reading this file (I KNOW THAT YOU ARE), the
copy of the file could be in many places. I'm writing
this file on my laptop in the wee hours of Friday Sep 21, 2018.
This file is called `README.md`, and it is written
in [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)
format, which is a popular format for writing documentation.
If you're looking at the file on GitHub, it is likely that
the Markdown has been compiled to HTML for your viewing
pleasure. In that case, it will have clickable links,
text with different formatting, and other niceties.

I'm about to commit this file to version control. In fact,
I'll do so right now. There, it is done. I just made commit
`1cc48cf5a3696f94676264e2f6dac38c2e23067d`---a unique commit
hash (or id) that has never before existed and shall never
again in the entire history and future of space time. Now
I'll make another. Boom, done.

If I type `git log` on my computer's terminal (if I'm in
the directory where this file is), I see the following output

```

    Initial commit
```

I want you to do what I've done. I want you to create a file
called "me.txt" and put your class nickname into it. Your class
nickname is something like "silly-eagle" and you can find it in
your "dashboard" on the class website. The names are randomly
generated and unique per class member.

Once you create that file, I want you to put it under version
control and push your repo back up to GitHub.

You'll need to use the following git commands to complete this
assignment: clone, add, commit, & push.

There is no automated grading code for this assignment yet.
So, you can't verify you've done what I've asked in an automated
fashion. Here is how you can verify manually. If you your repo
on GitHub has the file you created and it contains your class
nickname, you're ok. (Well, technically, the file should be 
in your "master" branch too. But, that is the default, so you're
likely ok there.) Stop by office hours if this is confusing.
